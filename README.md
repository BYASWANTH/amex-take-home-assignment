# People Directory Web Application

A lightweight React application demonstrating server-side and client-side data loading using a custom framework. The app includes a mock API layer using MSW, a Fastify backend, and esbuild for bundling.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will:
- Clean the `dist` folder
- Build the server and client using esbuild
- Start the Fastify backend

Visit the app at:  
ðŸ‘‰ `http://localhost:3000` or `http://[::1]:3000`

---

## Features

- `/appWithSSRData` â€“ Server-Side Rendered (SSR) people directory  
- `/appWithoutSSRData` â€“ Client-Side Rendered (CSR) people directory  
- Mocked API responses using MSW (Mock Service Worker)  
- Uses caching-fetch logic (to be implemented in Task 2)

## Tooling Notes

- **esbuild** is used for fast, zero-config bundling  
- **rimraf** replaces `rm -rf` for cross-platform compatibility  
- `.gitignore` includes:
  - `node_modules/`
  - `dist/`
  - `.idea/`

---

## Known Issues & Next Steps

- `useCachingFetch` and `preloadCachingFetch` are not yet implemented
- Linting and formatting tools like ESLint and Prettier are not yet configured
- Testing framework not included (recommend Vitest or Jest)
- No CI/CD integration configured
